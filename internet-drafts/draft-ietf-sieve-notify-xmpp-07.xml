      <t>This document describes a profile of the Sieve extension for notifications, to allow notifications to be sent over the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), also known as Jabber.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>

    <section title='Introduction' anchor='intro'>

      <section title='Overview' anchor='intro-overview'>
        <t>The <xref target="NOTIFY"/> extension to the <xref target="SIEVE"/> mail filtering language is a framework for providing notifications by employing URIs to specify the notification mechanism.  This document defines how xmpp URIs (see <xref target="XMPP-URI"/>) are used to generate notifications via the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (see <xref target='XMPP'/>), which is widely implemented in Jabber instant messaging technologies.</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Terminology' anchor='intro-terms'>
        <t>This document inherits terminology from <xref target='NOTIFY'/>, <xref target='SIEVE'/>, and <xref target='XMPP'/>.</t>
        <t>The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target='TERMS'/>.</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title='Definition' anchor='def'>

      <section title='Notify parameter "method"' anchor='def-method'>
        <t>The "method" parameter MUST be a URI that conforms to the xmpp URI scheme (as specified in <xref target='XMPP-URI'/>) and that identifies an XMPP account associated with the email inbox.  The URI MAY include the resource identifier portion of an XMPP address but SHOULD NOT include an authority component, query component, or fragment identifier component.  The processing application MUST extract an XMPP address from the URI in accordance with the processing rules specified in <xref target='XMPP-URI'/>.  The resulting XMPP address MUST be encapsulated in XMPP syntax as the value of the XMPP 'to' attribute.</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Test notify_method_capability' anchor='def-capability'>
        <t>In response to a notify_method_capability test for the "online" notification-capability, an implementation SHOULD return a value of "yes" if it has knowledge of an active presence session (see <xref target='XMPP-IM'/>) for the specified XMPP notification-uri; otherwise it SHOULD return a value of "maybe" (since typical XMPP systems may not allow a SIEVE engine to gain knowledge about the presence of XMPP entities).</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Notify tag ":from"' anchor='def-from'>
        <t>The ":from" tag has no special meaning for this notification mechanism, and this specification puts no restriction on its use.  As noted, the value of the XMPP 'from' attribute specified in the XMPP notification message MUST be the XMPP address of the notification service associated with the SIEVE engine.  The value of the ":from" tag MAY be transformed into XMPP syntax; if so, it SHOULD be encapsulated as the value of an XMPP <xref target='SHIM'/> header named "Reply-To".</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Notify tag ":importance"' anchor='def-importance'>
        <t>The ":importance" tag has no special meaning for this notification mechanism, and this specification puts no restriction on its use.  The value of the ":importance" tag MAY be transformed into XMPP syntax (in addition to or instead of including in the default message); if so, it SHOULD be encapsulated as the value of an XMPP <xref target='SHIM'/> header named "Urgency", where the XML character of that header is "high" if the value of the ":importance" tag is "1", "medium" if the value of the ":importance" tag is "2", and "low" if the value of the ":importance" tag is "3".</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Notify tag ":options"' anchor='def-options'>
        <t>The ":options" tag has no special meaning for this notification mechanism.  Any handling of this tag is the responsibility of an implementation.</t>
      </section>

      <section title='Notify tag ":message"' anchor='def-message'>
        <t>If the ":message" tag is included, that string MUST be transformed into the XML character data of an XMPP &lt;body/&gt; element (where the string is generated according to the guidelines specified in Section 3.6 of <xref target='NOTIFY'/>).  If the ":message" tag is not included, the rule specified in <xref target='NOTIFY'/> SHOULD be followed.</t>
      </section>

      <section title='XMPP syntax' anchor='def-syntax'>
        <t>The xmpp mechanism results in the sending of an XMPP message to notify a recipient about an email message.  The general XMPP syntax is as follows:</t>
        <t><list style='symbols'>
          <t>The notification MUST be an XMPP &lt;message/&gt; stanza.</t>
          <t>The value of the XMPP 'from' attribute MUST be the XMPP address of the notification service associated with the SIEVE engine.</t>
          <t>The value of the XMPP 'to' attribute MUST be the XMPP address specified in the XMPP URI contained in the "method" notify parameter.</t>
          <t>The value of the XMPP 'type' attribute MUST be 'headline' or 'normal'.</t>
          <t>The XMPP &lt;message/&gt; stanza MUST include a &lt;body/&gt; child element.  If the ":message" tag is included, that string MUST be used as the the XML character data of the &lt;body/&gt; element.  If not and if the XMPP URI contained in the "method" notify parameter specified a body, that value SHOULD be used.  Otherwise the XML character data SHOULD be some configurable text indicating that the message is a Sieve notification.</t>
          <t>The XMPP &lt;message/&gt; stanza MAY include a &lt;subject/&gt; child element.  If the XMPP URI contained in the "method" notify parameter specified a subject, that value SHOULD be used as the XML character data of the &lt;subject/&gt; element; otherwise the XML character data SHOULD be some configurable text indicating that the message is a Sieve notification.</t>
          <t>The notification SHOULD include a URI for the recipient to use as a hint in locating the message, encapsulated as the XML character data of a &lt;url/&gt; child element of an &lt;x/&gt; element qualified by the 'jabber:x:oob' namespace as specified in <xref target='OOB'/>.  If included, the URI SHOULD be an Internet Message Access Protocol <xref target='IMAP'/> URL that specifies the location of the message as defined in <xref target='IMAP-URL'/>, but MAY be another URI type that can specify or hint at the location of an email message, such as a URI for an HTTP resource <xref target='HTTP'/> or a POP3 mailbox <xref target='POP-URL'/> at which the message can be accessed.  It is not expected that an XMPP user agent shall directly handle such a URI, but instead that it shall invoke an appropriate helper application to handle the URI.</t>
        </list></t>
        <t>The recommended mapping of the Sieve notify action into XMPP syntax is described in the following sections.</t>
      </section>

    </section>

    <section title='Examples' anchor='examples'>
      <t>In the following examples, the sender of the email has an address of &lt;mailto:juliet@example.org&gt;, the entity to be notified has an XMPP address of romeo@example.com (resulting in an XMPP URI of &lt;xmpp:romeo@example.com&gt;), and the notification service associated with the SIEVE engine has an XMPP address of notify.example.com (resulting in an XMPP URI of &lt;xmpp:notify.example.com&gt;).</t>
      <section title='Basic action' anchor='examples-basic'>
        <t>The following is a basic Sieve notify action with only a method.  The message body and subject are therefore generated by the Sieve engine based on configuration.  The Sieve engine also includes a URI pointing to the message.</t>

        <t>The following action contains a message body in the XMPP URI but no ":message" tag in the Sieve script.  As a result, the body of the XMPP notification is taken from the XMPP URI.  In addition, the Sieve engine includes a URI pointing to the message.</t>

    <section title='Requirements Conformance' anchor='conformance'>
      <t>Section 3.8 of <xref target='NOTIFY'/> specifies a set of requirements for Sieve notification methods.  The conformance of the xmpp notification mechanism is provided here.</t>
      <t>
        <list style='numbers'>
          <t>An implementation of the xmpp notification method SHOULD NOT modify the final notification text (e.g., to limit the length); however, a given deployment MAY do so (e.g., if recipients pay per character or byte for XMPP messages).  Modification of characters themselves should not be necessary, since XMPP character data is encoded in <xref target='UTF-8'/>.</t>
          <t>An implementation MAY ignore parameters specified in the ":from", ":importance", and ":options" tags.</t>
          <t>There is no recommended default message for an implementation to include if the ":message" argument is not specified.</t>
          <t>A notification sent via the xmpp notification method MAY include a timestamp in the textual message.</t>
          <t>The value of the XMPP 'from' attribute MUST be the XMPP address of the notification service associated with the SIEVE engine.  The value of the Sieve ":from" tag MAY be transformed into the value of an XMPP <xref target='SHIM'/> header named "Reply-To".</t>
          <t>The value of the XMPP 'to' attribute MUST be the XMPP address specified in the XMPP URI contained in the ":method" parameter.</t>
          <t>In accordance with <xref target='XMPP-URI'/>, an implementation MUST ignore any URI action or parameter it does not understand (i.e., the URI MUST be processed as if the action or parameter were not present).  It is RECOMMENDED to support the XMPP "message" query type (see <xref target='QUERIES'/>) and the associated "body" and "subject" parameters, which parameters SHOULD be mapped to the XMPP &lt;body/&gt; and &lt;subject/&gt; child elements of the XMPP &lt;message/&gt; stanza type, respectively.  However, if included then the Sieve notify ":message" parameter MUST be mapped to the XMPP &lt;body/&gt; element, overriding the "body" parameter (if any) included in the XMPP URI.</t>
          <t>An implementation MUST NOT include any other extraneous information not specified in parameters to the notify action.</t>
          <t>In response to a notify_method_capability test for the "online" notification-capability, an implementation SHOULD return a value of "yes" if it has knowledge of an active presence session (see <xref target='XMPP-IM'/>) for the specified XMPP notification-uri; otherwise it SHOULD return a value of "maybe" (since typical XMPP systems may not allow a SIEVE engine to gain knowledge about the presence of XMPP entities).</t>
          <t>An implementation SHOULD NOT attempt to retry delivery of a notification if it receives an XMPP error of type "auth" or "cancel", MAY attempt to retry delivery if it receives an XMPP error of type "wait", and MAY attempt to retry delivery if it receives an XMPP error of "modify" but only if it makes appropriate modifications to the notification (see <xref target='XMPP'/>); in any case the number of retries SHOULD be limited to a configurable number no less than 3 and no more than 10.  An implementation MAY throttle notifications if the number of notifications within a given time period becomes excessive according to local service policy.  Duplicate suppression (if any) is a matter of implementation and is not specified herein.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title='Internationalization Considerations' anchor='i18n'>
      <t>Although an XMPP address may contain nearly any <xref target='UNICODE'/> character, the value of the "method" parameter MUST be a Uniform Resource Identifier (see <xref target='URI'/>) rather than an Internationalized Resource Identifier (see <xref target='IRI'/>).  The rules specified in <xref target='XMPP-URI'/> MUST be followed when generating XMPP URIs.</t>
      <t>In accordance with Section 13 of RFC 3920, all data sent over XMPP MUST be encoded in <xref target='UTF-8'/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='Security Considerations' anchor='sec'>
      <t>Depending on the information included, sending a notification can be comparable to forwarding mail to the notification recipient.  Care must be taken when forwarding mail automatically, to ensure that confidential information is not sent into an insecure environment.  In particular, implementations MUST conform to the security considerations given in <xref target='NOTIFY'/>, <xref target='SIEVE'/>, and <xref target='XMPP'/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title='IANA Considerations' anchor='iana'>
      <t>The following template provides the IANA registration of the Sieve notification mechanism specified in this document:</t>

<abstract><t>Users go to great lengths to be notified as quickly as possible that they have received new mail. Most of these methods involve polling to check for new messages periodically. A push method handled by the final delivery agent gives users quicker notifications and saves server resources. This document does not specify the notification method but it is expected that using existing instant messaging infrastructure such as XMPP, or SMS messages will be popular. This draft describes an extension to the Sieve mail filtering language that allows users to give specific rules for how and when notifications should be sent.</t></abstract>

It is meant to be extensible, simple, and independent of access protocol, mail architecture, and operating system. It is suitable for running on a mail server where users may not be allowed to execute arbitrary programs, such as on black box Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) servers, as the base language has no variables, loops, or ability to shell out to external programs.</t></abstract>

<abstract>
<t>
   The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
   protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
   systems.  It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for
   many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and
   distributed object management systems, through extension of its
   request methods, error codes and headers .  A feature of HTTP is
   the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems
   to be built independently of the data being transferred.
</t>
<t>
   HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information
   initiative since 1990.  This specification defines the protocol
   referred to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068 .

<abstract>
<t>The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4rev1) allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server. IMAP4rev1 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message folders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local folders. IMAP4rev1 also provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize with the server. IMAP4rev1 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes, checking for new messages, permanently removing messages, setting and clearing flags, RFC 2822 and RFC 2045 parsing, searching, and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof. Messages in IMAP4rev1 are accessed by the use of numbers. These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique identifiers. IMAP4rev1 supports a single server. A mechanism for accessing configuration information to support multiple IMAP4rev1 servers is discussed in RFC 2244. IMAP4rev1 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is handled by a mail transfer protocol such as RFC 2821. [STANDARDS TRACK] </t></abstract></front>
