<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>Rayo is an extension for controlling phone calls, audio mixers and a variety of advanced media resources such as speech recognizers, speech synthesizers and audio recorders. These capabilities can be combined to create a wide variety of applications such as menu-based phone systems, in-game conferencing and anonymous dating services. Unlike <a href='xep-0166.html'>Jingle</a>...</p>

<section1 topic='Requirements' anchor='reqs'>
  <p>The protocol defined herein is designed to meet the following requirements:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Call Control:</strong> Incoming calls are "offered" to clients at which point they can be answered, rejected, redirected to another destination, etc. Evey attempt is made to be shield the Rayo client from the low level telephony protocol (e.g. SIP, Jingle, PSTN, etc.)</li>
    <li><strong>Audio File Playback:</strong> A compatible Rayo server will fetch a file from a a specified URL and play the containing audio to the caller.</li>
    <li><strong>Speech Synthesis / TTS:</strong> In cases where dynamic data must be spoken, a Speech Synthesis engine many be used to play computer generated speech to the caller.</li>
    <li><strong>Touch-tone Events / DTMF:</strong> Rayo surfaces real-time event when the caller presses keys on their touch-tone keypad.</li>
    <li><strong>Speech Recognition:</strong> Enables the phone application to take spoken queues allowing for sophisticated voice-driven menus and directory services.</li>
    <li><strong>Call Recording:</strong> Can be used to capture the caller's voice (e.g. Voicemail) or both sides of the call for auditing and compliance purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Mixing:</strong> Typically referred to as an audio "conference" calls can be joined together so that the participants can hear each other in real-time.</li>

        <dt>Third-party call control (3PCC)</dt>
        <dd>The observation and/or control of a live media session by an entity which is not a direct party to the session.</dd>
      </di>
      <di>
        <dt>Command</dt>
        <dd>Commands instruct the receiving entity to perform some atomic action. Commands may be executed against a given call, component or mixer and can be considered completed as soon as they receive a response.</dd>
      </di>
      <di>
        <dt>Component</dt>
        <dd>Components extend the Rayo protocol by providing additional media and call control functionality. Components are similar to commands, but have a lifecycle attached to them. A component, once created and attached to a call or mixer, will respond giving an ID that it is known by. The component will then begin execution, and may trigger events or have commands issued to it. Finally, once the component is stopped or comes to an end naturally, it will issue a special &lt;complete/&gt; event</dd>

  <p>In order for an application to determine whether an entity supports this protocol, where possible it SHOULD use the dynamic, presence-based profile of service discovery defined in &xep0115;.

    <p>Rayo sessions can be resource-intensive. Therefore, it is possible to launch a denial-of-service attack against an entity by burdening it with too many Rayo sessions.

    <p>Rayo communications can be enabled through gateways to non-XMPP networks, whose security characteristics can be quite different from those of XMPP networks.

    <p>Mere negotiation of a Rayo session can expose sensitive information about the parties (e.g. IP addresses). Care must be taken in communicating such information, and end-to-end encryption should be used if the parties do not trust the intermediate servers or gateways.</p>

<section1 topic='History' anchor='history'>
  Prior to the development of the Rayo protocol, the most widely-used 3PCC protocols were Asterisk's AGI and AMI. Unfortunately, these protocols have many drawbacks, not least in their inconsistency and relatively poor documentation, but also in that they are poorly secured and lacking in attributes required for significant scalability. Much 3PCC activity is also done using process-internal APIs rather than a wire protocol like XMPP.

  <p>Rayo was developed to satisfy three main desires:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To separate the application logic from the back-end call processing infrastructure for large-scale scripting-based hosted voice application platforms. This helps to ensure that the performance of the back-end infrastructure cannot be impacted by the applications controling it, and specifically to allow sandboxing the applications.</li>
    <li>To create a platform-agnostic protocol for the control of live media sessions that has been designed from the start for such use.</li>
    <li>To enable authenticated, federated, web-scale 3PCC on platforms with APIs only suitable for trusted internal use (Asterisk, FreeSWITCH, etc).</li>
  </ul>

  Initial development of the Rayo specification and its reference implementation was provided by Voxeo Labs and Telefónica, with Punchblock being the first client library implementation, as part of the Adhearsion project. Since the beginning of the development process, further implementation efforts have begun on top of Asterisk's AGI/AMI protocols, as well as client library implementations in Node/CoffeeScript and Python.
